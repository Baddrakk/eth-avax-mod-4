THIS FILE IS TO SHOW THE WORK I HAVE DONE ON METACRAFTERS ON ETH
In this i have give a task to create a gaming token for Degen Gaming and the user can mint, burn and transfer the token.
The mint function would be used to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards for their participation in the game. The burn function would be used to destroy tokens, which could be used to control the supply of tokens and to prevent inflation. The transfer function would allow players to send tokens to each other.
THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE
PLEASE REVIEW MY PROJECT
THANKS METACRAFTERS !!
